The goal of net.meta is to ...

## Installation

(No yet) You can install the released version of net.meta from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: 

``` r
## install.packages("net.meta")

remotes::install_github(“meta2020/net.meta”, upgrade = FALSE)
library(net.meta)

```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(net.meta)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:


You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
